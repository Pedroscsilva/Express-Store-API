# Express Store API

This was an awesome project to develop. It works with a Model, Service, and Controller (MSC) architeture.

I've also developed unit tests to the vast majority of the API.

If you want to check it, you can clone this repository.

Provided you have Docker and docker-compose installed on your machine, you may follow the commands below in your terminal to see the API working:

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker exec -it store_manager bash
```

It should open the bash version of the newly created container. After that, you can install the project's node_modules and start the API.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

If you want to check how the tests are working, you can either go to the tests directory or execute the testing script with:

```sh
$ npm run test
```

If you would like any help executing it or if you have any suggestion on how to improve this code, please reach me out!
